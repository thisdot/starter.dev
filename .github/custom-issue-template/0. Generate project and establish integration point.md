# Background
To make tasks parallelizable, we should create kits via integration branches to make PRs smaller and easier to read while not breaking the upstream build. Integration branches may be cleaner and easier to implement in isolation as kits are isolated to their own directory anyway.

# Acceptance
- [ ] Generate new project in the `starters/` creating a name that includes 'framework-store-style' format
- [ ] Find the title in the `<head>` of the public facing index.html (this depends from framework, but usually found in "src/public" folder) and change it to "framework-store-style starter kit"
- [ ] Change the name and description in the package.json
- [ ] Merge change into an integration branch
