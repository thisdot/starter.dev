# Background
We want to launch each kit with an example of a component that fetches data from a data source and related tests. We have an endpoint set up as a simple hello world that accepts a greeting for example sake.

# Acceptance
- [ ] Create an API example component
- [ ] The component should make a GET request to `https://api.starter.dev/hello?greeting=<message>` where the message is "angular-apollo-tailwind starter.dev!"
- [ ] The component should display the message from the API in the UI
- [ ] The component should have a storybook story
- [ ] The component should have a set of reasonable tests demonstrating how to mock APIs

# Note:
The mock shows RxJs but that is just because it was created for a different KIT. Use the tool chosen for you current Kit
