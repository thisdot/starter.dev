# Background

Storybook is a great way to build and test components in a sandbox. Most teams opt out of Storybook because it takes time to setup. We should make it easy to add stories and colocate them with their components.

# Acceptance

- [ ] Storybook setup: Add Storybook to the project and get it running.
- [ ] Remove default stories: Storybook ships with default stories. These should be removed as they are just examples that can be looked up later online.
- [ ] Add ability to colocate stories: Storybook needs some configuration to make colocated stories render correctly. The intention is you colocate a story file with the component it documents. Learn more here: https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/overview
- [ ] Add ability to add page stories: Some people only focus on component-level stories while others try to do page level stories. We should provide a pattern for providing both. In metaframeworks, colocated page stories might not be possible so define a pattern for allowing for page level stories.
- [ ] Add good plugins: Storybook has a collection of plugins that are great for creating interactive stories. We should include some of the plugins including ones for accessibility, actions, and adjusting component inputs. See https://storybook.js.org/integrations for more details.

# NOTE:

Timebox: 8 hours (some newer technologies don't play well yet with Storybook, and we don't want to spin indefinitely)
