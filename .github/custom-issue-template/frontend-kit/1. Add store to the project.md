# Background

Each kit should have a provided state manager setup and be configured for usage. Most frontend applications require some level of state management. This can be done in several ways pending the implementation. Redux is a great example of a global store that manages UI state and its relation to server data. React Query and Apollo Client are good tools for managing server state. Sometimes a page’s route in conjunction with a metaframework router is sufficient to maintain a page’s state. Whatever the decision, we should provide a configured set of a tooling a consumer can use out of the box.

# Acceptance

- [ ] All solutions require some level of application-level configuration or a sample store. This should be included as part of the kit.
- [ ] Test that the store works succesfully.
- [ ] There is a detailed explanation in the kit’s README.
