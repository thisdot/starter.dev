# Background

We want to launch each kit with an example of a component that fetches data from a data source and related tests. We have an endpoint set up as a simple hello world that accepts a greeting for example sake.

# Acceptance

- [ ] Create an API example component
- [ ] (if using REST)The component should make a GET request to `https://api.starter.dev/hello?greeting=<message>` where the message is "framework-store-style starter.dev!"
- [ ] (if using GraphQL) above equivalent using endpoint `https://api.starter.dev/graphql`
- [ ] When it successfully retrieves data the component should display the message from the API in the UI
- [ ] The message should be customizable
- [ ] When loading, display a loading state
- [ ] When an error occurs, display an error state
- [ ] The component should have a Storybook story
- [ ] The component should have a set of reasonable tests demonstrating how to mock APIs

# Note:

The mock shows RxJs but that is just because it was created for a different KIT. Use the tool chosen for you current Kit
