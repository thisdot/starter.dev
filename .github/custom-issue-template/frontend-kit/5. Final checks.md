# Background

Once the kit has been finalized, we want to do a few final checks to make sure it meets the criteria in the specifications.

# Acceptance

- [ ] Set project to Use the latest version of Typescript
- [ ] A .nvmrc file should be provided with the kit to specify the node version used to ensure users are using the targeted node version.
- [ ] The lockfile from the project should be excluded to allow users to utilize their package manager of choice. The project should work equally well using any package manager.
- [ ] Because the lockfile is excluded, kits should pin their dependency version numbers to a fixed value.
