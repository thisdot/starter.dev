# Background

Component testing is an important out-of-the-box feature for kits. We should provide a configured testing toolchain. Jest & Vitest are currently the most popular but Cypress Component Testing is an option as well. We should also provide popular and commonly used extensions such as testing-library to help with accessibility testing. Each kit should have a provided a unit testing framework fully installed and configured to be used.

# Acceptance

- [ ] Add the chosen testing framework.
- [ ] When I run `yarn test`, I should see the tests pass on a simple `expect(true).toBe(true)` test.
- [ ] Ensure there is a detailed explanation of intended use and expansion in the kitâ€™s README.
