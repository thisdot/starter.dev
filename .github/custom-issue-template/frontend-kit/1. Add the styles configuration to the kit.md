# Background

Most modern frameworks don’t use standard CSS and opt for solutions that make writing styles easier whether it be a preprocessor language, component library, or utility framework. Our job is to define those standards. Each kit should have a styling setup and be configured for usage.

# Acceptance

- [ ] All solutions require some level of application-level configuration. This should be included as part of the kit. Add and configure the style methodology choosen for this KIT.
- [ ] Whatever solution you choose, ensure there is a detailed explanation of intended use and expansion in the kit’s README. Make sure the style work both in Dev and Production mode.
