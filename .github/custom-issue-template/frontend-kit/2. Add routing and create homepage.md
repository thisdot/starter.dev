# Background

Whether this is a kit for a SPA or MPA, routing will be a factor. We should provide a standard way for defining and implementing routes. We want to demonstrate basic routing as part of each kit. To do so, we want a homepage that directs to all the examples we've created thus far.

# Acceptance

- [ ] All solutions require some level of application-level configuration.
- [ ] Create a basic homepage that lives at `/`
- [ ] Route the counter component to `/counter`
- [ ] Route the API component to `/api-example`
- [ ] Ensure there is a detailed explanation of intended use and expansion in the kitâ€™s README.

# Note:

- The mock was taken from a different kit. Change the text to be align with the current kit
