# Background
We want to demonstrate basic routing as part of each kit. To do so, we want a homepage that directs to all the examples we've created thus far.

# Acceptance
- [ ] Add and configure routing
- [ ] Create a basic homepage that lives at `/`
- [ ] Route the counter component to `/counter`
- [ ] Route the API component to `/api-example`

# Note:
- The mock was taken from a different kit. Change the text to be align with the current kit
