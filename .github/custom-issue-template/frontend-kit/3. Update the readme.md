# Background

The kit should include a thorough README with all architectural decisions the user should be aware of when utilizing it. It shouldn't rewrite docs for existing libraries but any key decisions should be documented. This is what will be visible to users on the website when they look at the details page. The README should include the following sections:

- Overview
  - Whatâ€™s included in the kit
  - Any key tooling provided
- Installation
  - Getting started instructions including:
    - Environment setup
    - Running a local develop server
- Available Scripts and Commands
  - Scripts available through the kit and their purpose
  - Consider separating into sections
- Project Structure
  - An explanation of the project directory structure so the consumer can understand how to extend it
  - A list of default routes/features that the consumer can look at to understand the system
- Technology Specific Section(s)
  - For each technology used, a section on key details of that technology such as additionally required configuration or key customizations to consider.
  - Describe decisions around why certain decisions were or were not made.
  - How to extend the app regarding the technology
- Deployment
  - Recommended instructions for deploying the application.

> ### Manual
>
> ```bash
> git clone https://github.com/thisdot/starter.dev.git
> ```
>
> - Copy and rename the `starters/<kit name>` directory to the name of your new project.
> - `cd` into your project directory and run `npm install`.
> - Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
