# Background
We want to launch each kit with an example of a component with state and good tests. We've chosen a counter for this reason.

# Acceptance
- [ ] Create a counter component
- [ ] The counter should have an increment, decrement, and reset button
- [ ] The counter should display its current value
- [ ] The counter should be controlled by the global state manager
- [ ] The counter should have a storybook story
- [ ] The counter should have a set of tests demonstrating how to verify all its features

# Mock
