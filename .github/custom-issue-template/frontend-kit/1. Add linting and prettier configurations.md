# Background
Having code style consistency is important for any project. A standardized set of options should be set that can be overwritten by the implementer at a later date.

# Acceptance
- [ ] Establish eslint/tslint rules and configuration
- [ ] Install and configure prettier
- [ ] Configure editorconfig settings
- [ ] Run linting and prettier on entire project and correct any errors

# NOTE:
This task has already been completed many times on different KITs, so we should make sure to look at those configurations first and try not to reinvent the wheel :)
