# Background

Having code style consistency is important for any project. A standardized set of options should be set that can be overwritten by the implementer at a later date.

# Acceptance

- [ ] Establish eslint/tslint rules and configuration. Code formatting should be enforced via ESLint rules. Rules should be set to the strictest setting and enforced via CI. The standard rules for a stack should be selected and if there are specialized plugins, those should be utilized and appropriately tuned.
- [ ] Install and configure prettier. Prettier should be configured to save on format and align with the established ESLint rules.
- [ ] Configure editorconfig settings. Most editors support the EditorConfig syntax. Setting the projectâ€™s editor settings to align with the selected ESLint & Prettier rules should be established for code conformity and to improve the developer experience.
- [ ] Tabs: It has been proven that tabs are better than spaces for accessibility purposes. As such, all tooling should be configured to use tabs when possible. YAML is a known exception.
- [ ] Run linting and prettier on entire project and correct any errors

# NOTE:

This task has already been completed many times on different KITs, so we should make sure to look at those configurations first and try not to reinvent the wheel :)
