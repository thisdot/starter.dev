# Background

There are a few final details that need to be in place for each backend kit.

# Acceptance

- [ ] Typescript - kit uses the latest version of TypeScript
- [ ] .nvmrc - A .nvmrc file should be provided with the kit to specify the node version used to ensure users are using the targeted node version
- [ ] No lock files - the lockfile from the project should be excluded to allow users to utilize their package manager of choice
- [ ] Pinned dependency versions - because the lockfile is excluded, kits should pin their dependency version numbers to a fixed value
