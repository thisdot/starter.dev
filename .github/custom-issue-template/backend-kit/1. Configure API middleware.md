# Background

Regardless of REST or GraphQL, the API will have a middleware that needs configuration for things like CORS or routing for REST and schema stitching for GraphQL. This issue is to setup the API to be usable out of the box.

# Acceptance

- [ ] Update CORS configurations
- [ ] Ensure routing patterns are working and defined
- [ ] Setup any middleware (if applicable)
