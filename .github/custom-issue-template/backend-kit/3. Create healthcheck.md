# Background

All APIs should come with a default healthcheck endpoint. The healthcheck should provide a response indicating that all systems are operational. If a data source is involved, respond with data from the data source or something about that connection.

# Acceptance

- [ ] There should be an endpoint or graphql query that provides a healthcheck response
