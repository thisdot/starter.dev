# Background

If your API implementation doesn't provide a documentation system out of the box, configure self documenting endpoints. For REST, this will probably be something like Swagger. For GraphQL, most implementations provide this out of the box.

# Acceptance

- [ ] Configure auto-generated documentation for API endpoints or GraphQL operations
