## Overview

### Tech Stack

- [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### Included Tooling

- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) - Test runner
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) - Component library
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - Code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - Code formatting

### Architectural Decisions

#### State management

Managing state between components is a big part of creating modern web applications. Typically, this is done by using a third-party package. Sometimes it can be combined with fetching server data (e.g., Apollo or Tanstack Query).

##### Considered Options

- **Tanstack Query** - Used in other starter kits and offers a lean setup combining state and server communication
- **createResource** - Built-in SolidJS and offers a similar experience to Tanstack Query

##### Decision

Use SolidJS' native `createResource` as it comes bundles and is the "solid way" of handling things.

### Example Components

#### Counter `src/components/CounterExample`

A small counter example which showcases how to use state in SolidJS. You can view the example on the `src/pages/Counter`.

Signals can live outside of components. Each relevant component subscribes to its value by using it.

#### Fetch `src/components/FetchExample`

Demonstrates how to retrieve data from a third-party API by using `createResource`.

## Installation

### CLI (Recommended)

```bash
npm i -g pnpm
pnpm dlx create-starter-dev
```

- Follow the prompts to select the <kit name> starter kit and name your new project.
- `cd` into your project directory and run `pnpm install`.
- Run `pnpm run dev` to start the development server.
- Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` to see the included example code running.

### Manual

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thisdot/starter.dev.git
```

- Copy and rename the `starters/solidjs-tailwind` directory to the name of your new project.
- `cd` into your project directory and run `pnpm install`.
- Run `pnpm run dev` to start the development server.
- Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` to see the included example code running.

## Commands

- `pnpm run dev` - Runs the development server on localhost port 3000 with HMR
- `pnpm run test` - Runs the test suite
- `pnpm run storbook` - To showcase the component library
- `pnpm run build` - Builds a production version of the app to deploy
- `pnpm run serve` - Serves a production build on localhost port 4173
- `pnpm run lint` - Uses eslint to find potential issues in the codebase
- `pnpm run lint-fix` - Tries to auto fix potential issues
- `pnpm run format` - Fixes formatting issues in the codebase

## Demo Implementation

[Repository](https://github.com/thisdot/starter.dev-showcases/tree/main/solidjs-tailwind)

The demo application re-implements some of GitHub's pages and functionality. It uses the OAuth credentials in GitHub to authenticate users with their GitHub accounts and uses RxJS to fetch data from the GitHub API. Check out the link above to learn more or check out the demo!
