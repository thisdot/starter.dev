## How to configure your Shopify store

This template requires a [paid Shopify plan](https://www.shopify.com/pricing).

> Note: This template will not work with a Shopify Starter plan as it does not allow installation of custom themes, which is required to run as a headless storefront.

### Add Shopify domain to an environment variable

Create a `SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN` environment variable and use your Shopify domain as the the value (ie. `[your-shopify-store-subdomain].myshopify.com`).

> Note: Do not include the `https://`.

### Accessing the Shopify Storefront API

This template utilizes [Shopify's Storefront API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/storefront) to create unique customer experiences. The API offers a full range of commerce options making it possible for customers to control products, collections, menus, pages, cart, checkout, and more.

In order to use the Shopify's Storefront API, you need to install the [Headless app](https://apps.shopify.com/headless) in your Shopify store.

Once installed, you'll need to create a `SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable and use the public access token as the value.

> Note: Shopify does offer a Node.js Storefront API SDK. We use the Storefront API via GraphQL directly instead of the Node.js SDK so we have more control over fetching and caching.

## Installation

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](https://github.com/thisdot/starter.dev/blob/main/starters/shopify-next-tailwind/.env.example) to run Next.js Commerce. A `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control your Shopify store.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

If you want to tag and create a release for your project during your development, you could find a GitHub Worflow template example in the [GitHub Workflow folder](https://github.com/thisdot/starter.dev/tree/main/starters/shopify-next-tailwind/.github/worflows) inside the project.
