### Example Code

In this `starters/nuxt-pinia-tailwind` directory you will find the `TheCounter` and `TheGreeting` directories. 

The `TheCounter` directory component uses `Pinia` to control the state of the component. The directory contains the following files:

- TheCounter.stories.ts
- TheCounter.classNames.ts
- TheCounter.test.ts
- TheCounter.vue

The `TheGreeting` directory component uses `@nuxtjs/axios` to fetch data from the example hello endpoint with a corresponding mock located in `test/__mocks__/handlers/greeting.ts`. The directory contains the following files:

- TheGreeting.stories.ts
- TheGreeting.classNames.ts
- TheGreeting.test.ts
- TheGreeting.vue

## Demo Implementation

[Repository](https://github.com/thisdot/starter.dev-showcases/tree/main/nuxt-pinia-tailwind)

The demo application tries to implement some of GitHub's pages and functionality. It uses the OAuth credentials in GitHub to authenticate users with their GitHub accounts and uses @nuxt/axios to fetch data from the GitHub REST API. Check out the link above to learn more or check out the demo!
