## Overview

### Tech Stack

- [Remix v1.x](https://remix.run/)
- [React v17.x](https://reactjs.org)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS v3.x](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### Included Tooling

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - Test runner
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Type checking
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) - Component library
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - Code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - Code formatting
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Storybook builder

### Kit Organization / Architecture

For this kit, we maintained the [Remix convention](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/api/conventions) and we do recommend it. For the `app/components` folder, each component is co-located with its tests and stories. This structure makes it easy to find all the code and functionality related to a specific component. Due to Remix's preference for data fetching from the route page, the components are primarily simple view components.

- #### Storybook

  Storybook was introduced because it is really a great tool for testing components in isolation and good for documentation.
  As of [Remix v1.x](https://remix.run/), Storybook isn't supported and doesn't work well with Remix, so [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) was used in building Storybook to work properly. This might change in the future.

- #### Styling

This kit utilizes Tailwind for styling based on Remix's preference and due to the fact that other CSS libraries such as Styled Components and CSS Modules aren't supported currently. See https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/guides/styling for more information.
  The styles are exported from a `<componentName>.classNames.ts` as named exports, this is majorly to avoid [surface styling](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/guides/styling#surfacing-styles) which can be a bit complex. Also, you could write the Tailwind classes inline but this method is used to keep the file clean and ensure reusability of styles.

If you want to follow this pattern, take a look at our GitHub demo implementation below. Using this structure makes it easy to find all the code and functionality related to a specific component.

### Example Components

In this `remix-gql-tailwind/app/components` directory you will find the `Counter` and `Greeting` directory.

The `Counter` directory contains the following files:

- Counter.stories.tsx
- Counter.classNames.ts
- Counter.test.tsx
- Button.tsx
- Counter.tsx
- index.ts

The `Greeting` directory contains the following files:

- Greeting.stories.tsx
- Greeting.classNames.ts
- Greeting.test.tsx
- Greeting.tsx
- index.ts

## Demo Implementation

[Repository](https://github.com/thisdot/starter.dev-github-showcases/tree/main/remix)

The demo application tries to implement some of GitHub's pages and functionality. It uses the OAuth credentials in GitHub to authenticate users with their GitHub accounts and uses graphql-request to fetch data from the GitHub Graphql API.
