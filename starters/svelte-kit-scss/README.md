## Architecture Decisions

For this kit, we maintained the [SvelteKit Project Structure](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/project-structure) and we do recommend it. For the `src/lib/components` folder, each component is co-located with its tests and stories. This structure makes it easy to find all the code and functionality related to a specific component. Due to SvelteKit's preference for data fetching from the route page, the components are primarily simple view components.

- Storybook

  Storybook was introduced because it is a great tool for testing components in isolation and good for documentation.

- Styling

  Svelte comes with sass support. Sass is one of the most mature, stable, and powerful professional-grade CSS extension language. It quickly allows us to design robust components.

- Example Components

  In this `svelte-kit-scss/src/lib/components` directory you will find the `Counter` and `Greeting` directory.

  The `Counter` directory contains the following files:

  - Counter.spec.ts
  - Counter.svelte
  - Counter.stories.ts

  The `Greeting` directory contains the following files:

  - Greeting.spec.ts
  - Greeting.svelte
  - Greeting.stories.ts

## Demo Implementation

[Repository](https://github.com/thisdot/starter.dev-github-showcases/tree/main/svelte-kit-scss)

[Live Application](http://svelte-kit-scss.starter.dev/)

The demo application tries to implement some of GitHub's pages and functionality. It uses the OAuth credentials in GitHub to authenticate users with their GitHub accounts and uses svelte's fetch api to fetch data from the GitHub API. Check out the link above to learn more or check out the demo!
