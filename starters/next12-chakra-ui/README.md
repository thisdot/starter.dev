## Overview

This Next.js 12 starter kit comes with formatting, linting, example components, testing and styling. Here is the complete list of technologies and tooling used in this kit:

- [Next.js 12](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12)
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - Test runner
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Type checking
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) - Component library
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - Code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - Code formatting

## Installation

### CLI (Recommended)

```bash
npm create @this-dot/starter -- --kit next12-chakra-ui
```

or

```bash
yarn create @this-dot/starter --kit next12-chakra-ui
```

- Follow the prompts to select the `next12-chakra-ui` starter kit and name your new project.
- `cd` into your project directory and run `yarn install`.
- Run `yarn run dev` to start the development server.
- Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` to see the included example code running.

### Manual

This requires a download of the entire starter.dev repository and extraction of the `next12-chakra-ui` kit from the starters directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thisdot/starter.dev.git
```

- Copy and rename the `starters/next12-chakra-ui` directory to the name of your new project.
- `cd` into your project directory and run `yarn install`.
- Run `yarn run dev` to start the development server.
- Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` to see the included example code running.

## Commands

- `yarn run dev` - Starts the development server.
- `yarn run test` - Runs the unit tests.
- `yarn run storybook` - Starts the Storybook UI.
- `yarn run lint` - Runs ESLint on the project.
- `yarn run format:fix` - Formats code for the entire project

## State management

For this starter kit we are not using a global state manager but instead storing state inside the routes for Next.js. For example, please look at the `/src/pages/counter-example.tsx` and `src/pages/fetch-example.tsx` files.

## Testing

### Unit testing

The unit tests for the home page can be found in the `__tests__` directory.

```
.
├── Counter.test.tsx
├── Greeting.test.tsx
└── index.test.tsx
```

### Storybook's Accessibility testing

This starter kit comes with the `@storybook/addon-a11y` which is used to check for common accessibility errors in your components. When you run `yarn run storybook`, each story will show detailed explanations with suggested fixes if errors are found.

## Chakra UI's Customizable theme

Inside the `src/pages/_app.tsx` directory, you will find the basic setup for customizing your theme, colors, and font styles using Chakra UI.

```js
const colors = {
  brand: {
    50: "#1a365d",
    100: "#153e75",
    500: "#2464ec",
  },
};

const fontWeights = {
  normal: 400,
  medium: 600,
  bold: 800,
};

const breakpoints = {
  sm: "320px",
  md: "768px",
  lg: "960px",
  xl: "1200px",
};

export const theme = extendTheme({ colors, fontWeights, breakpoints });
```

### Example Components

#### API routes example

Inside the `src/pages/api` directory, you will find a `hello.ts` file which includes an example on how to create your own API's with Next.js 12.

```js
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";

type Data = {
  name: string,
};

export default function handler(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse<Data>
) {
  res.status(200).json({ name: "This Dot Labs" });
}
```

#### Counter Example

Inside the `src/components/Counter` directory, you will find the `Counter.tsx` and `Counter.stories.tsx` files. In this example, you will see how to work with Chakra UI components in Next.js 12. You will also see examples on how to write stories for your components using Storybook.

#### Fetch example

Inside the `src/pages` directory, you will find the `fetch-example.tsx` which demonstrates how to fetch data using Next.js 12. Inside the `src/components/Greeting` directory, the `Greeting.stories.tsx` provides examples on how to write stories for your components using Storybook.

## Kit Organization / Architecture

At the root level, you will find all of the testing, linting, Prettier formatting, Storybook and TypeScript configurations along with the `src` and `public` directories.

Inside the `src` directory, you will find the following structure:

```
.
├── components
│   ├── Counter
│   │   ├── Counter.stories.tsx
│   │   ├── Counter.tsx
│   │   └── index.ts
│   ├── Greeting
│   │   ├── Greeting.stories.tsx
│   │   ├── Greeting.tsx
│   │   └── index.ts
│   └── index.ts
└── pages
    ├── api
    │   └── hello.ts
    ├── _app.tsx
    ├── counter-example.tsx
    ├── fetch-example.tsx
    └── index.tsx

```

## How to deploy your project

You can use services like Netlify or Vercel to deploy your application. Both of these services will come with a built-in CI/CD pipeline and live previews.
