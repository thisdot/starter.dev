        starter.dev aims to help developers spend more time building features
        and learning technologies rather than configuring them. We'd love to
        include your ideas as part of our collection of kits. Let us know in the
        issues of any improvements you'd like to contribute or open a pull
        request with a new kit you want to include. We'd love to collaborate
        with you to make this a valuable resource for everyone.
